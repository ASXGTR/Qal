# QAL Simulation: Passwords, Access Codes & Editor Tools

> **Notice:** All credentials listed below are purely simulated default test vectors hardcoded for this Unity Software-in-the-Loop demonstration. They have zero utility outside of testing this simulation project.

## 1. Unity Editor Tools: Launching the Fake APKs

The mobile phone transmitters (Fake APKs) are not buttons inside the runtime game viewport. They are custom **Unity Editor Windows** docked into your workspace.

To open and test the mobile phone transmission tools:
1. Look at the **Top Menu Bar** across the top of the Unity Editor.
2. Select the **QAL** or custom tools tab.
3. Open any of the three virtual mobile device simulators:
   * **Fake APK (Master Owner):** Emits rolling acoustic tokens, pairs devices, and sets master credentials.
   * **Fake APK (Guest Driver):** Simulates delegated short-term acoustic tokens and temporary access slots.
   * **Fake APK (Dealership / Fleet):** Emits default showroom acoustic unlock tokens.

## 2. Dealership Showroom Mode Login

When entering the Dealership Showroom scene or station panel:

### Primary Station Login
* **Dealer ID:** `DEALER-LIV01`
* **Password:** `DEALER-PASS-2026`

### Default / Quick-Test Login
* **Dealer ID:** `DEALER-DEFAULT`
* **Password:** `DEALER-DEFAULT`

### Dealership Manual Override Modal
* **Password:** `DEALER-DEFAULT` (or `DEALER-PASS-2026`)

## 3. Hidden Technician Gateway (Unmasking Trigger)

In standard Consumer Mode, technician access is concealed from the regular driver interface:

1. Click **Manual Override** on the vehicle console.
2. Leave the input box completely blank.
3. Click **Submit** three consecutive times with an empty input.
4. The system will detect three consecutive empty submissions and unmask the hidden **Technician Gateway**.

## 4. Institutional Terminal Access Codes

Once the Technician Gateway is unmasked:

### A. Authorised Technician Panel (Workshop Bay)
* **Dealership Station Code:** `DEALER-LIV01`  
*(Unlocks diagnostic maintenance mode, clears anti-tamper lockouts, and bypasses the immobilizer for workshop repairs).*

### B. Authorised Forensic & Statutory Recovery Hub
* **Statutory Token / Warrant ID:** `POLICE-FORENSIC`  
*(Alternative accepted warrant code:* `WARRANT-99`*)*  
*(Unlocks blackbox audit logs, hash chains, and allows flatbed recovery winch shift-by-wire park-lock release).*

---

## 5. Consumer Master Password & Guest PIN Rules

### Master Owner Password (Created at Runtime)
* Configured by the user in the initial setup screen or Owner panel.
* **Length:** Minimum 6 characters.
* **Character Set:** Strict alphanumeric and hyphens only (`A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`, and `-`).
* Normalized to uppercase automatically.

### Delegated Guest Keys
* Generated dynamically inside the Owner APK.
* **Format:** Secure 6-digit random PINs with built-in anti-collision and anti-trivial dispersion logic (avoids patterns like `123456` or repeated digits).
